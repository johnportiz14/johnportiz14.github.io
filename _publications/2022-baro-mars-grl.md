**Abstract:**
> Both the source of methane on Mars and the mechanism for transmission from the subsurface to the atmosphere are not fully understood. Previous seepage simulations have invoked relatively shallow subsurface sources to explain observed methane signatures on Mars. We propose that barometric-pressure pumping through fracture networks could be an effective mechanism for methane transport from the deep subsurface on Mars. Using atmospheric pressure data gathered by <i>Curiosity</i> as input, we simulate methane gas transport from depths of 200 m to the surface. Even with such a deep source, our model reproduces the observed seasonality of methane, and the simulated surface methane fluxes fall within the range of previous estimates derived from atmospheric observations. Because 200 m is the likely minimum hospitable depth for living methanogenic microbes, our fracture network model indirectly reinvigorates the possibility of a microbial source of methane on Mars.
