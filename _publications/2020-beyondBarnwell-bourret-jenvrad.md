**Abstract:** 
> An underground nuclear explosion (UNE) generates radioactive gases that can be transported through fractures to the ground surface over timescales of hours to months. If detected, the presence of particular short-lived radionuclides in the gas can provide strong evidence that a recent UNE has occurred. By drawing comparisons between sixteen similar historical U.S. UNEs where radioactive gas was or was not detected, we identified factors that control the occurrence and timing of breakthrough at the ground surface. The factors that we evaluated include the post-test atmospheric conditions, local geology, and surface geology at the UNE sites. The UNEs, all located on Pahute Mesa on the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS), had the same announced yield range (20â€“150 kt), similar burial depths in the unsaturated zone, and were designed and performed by the same organization during the mid-to-late 1980s. Results of the analysis indicate that breakthrough at the ground surface is largely controlled by a combination of the post-UNE barometric pressure changes in the months following the UNE, and the volume of air-filled pore space above the UNE. Conceptually simplified numerical models of each of the 16 historical UNEs that include these factors successfully predict the occurrence (5 of the UNEs) or lack of occurrence (remaining 11 UNEs) of post-UNE gas seepage to the ground surface. However, the data analysis and modeling indicates that estimates of the meteorological conditions and of the post-UNE, site-specific subsurface environment including air-filled porosity, in combination, may be necessary to successfully predict late-time detectable gas breakthrough for a suspected UNE site.
