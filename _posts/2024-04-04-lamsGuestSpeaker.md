Delivered a series of five presentations and led discussions over two days on
measuring atmospheric methane on Mars with the *Curiosity* rover to several 7<sup>th</sup>
and 8<sup>th</sup> grade classes of Life Sciences and Astronomy students at Los Alamos
Middle School.

 This was a great experience -- the students were engaged and asked really thoughtful questions!
