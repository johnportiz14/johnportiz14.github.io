**Abstract:** Gas transport through variably-saturated geologic media
has important applications for nuclear nonproliferation, as noble gas
detection is one of the best candidates for the verification of
clandestine underground nuclear events. The transport properties of
porous geologic media with respect to such gases are of fundamental
importance in developing accurate predictive transport models to
determine the origin of detected nuclear signatures. We therefore aim
to characterize the diffusion of gaseous krypton, xenon, and sulfur
hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) through intact porous rock with varying degrees of
liquid saturation in order to quantify vapor diffusion coefficients and
relate them to changes in rock saturation. We conducted a series of
diffusion cell experiments using intact tuff cores at varying
saturations. We fit the experimental results using Finite Element Heat
and Mass (FEHM) numerical model simulations to calculate effective
vapor phase diffusion coefficients for each gas and saturation. Results
will be used to develop more accurate transport models for subsurface
fission product releases, which have implications for treaty
verification, repository science, and radioactive contaminant
transport.
