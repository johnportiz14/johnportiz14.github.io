**Abstract:** Radionuclide gases produced by underground nuclear explosions (UNEs) can seep to
the earthâ€™s surface over periods of hours to months. Later-time gas transport (i.e. that
transport not taking place immediately after the explosion) can represent a significant
portion of radionuclide gas brought to the surface. The later-time gas seepage is driven
by atmospheric pressure fluctuations (i.e. barometric pumping), which is a complicated
phenomenon caused by many processes (i.e., atmospheric tides, weather patterns,
latitude, lunar cycle, seasons). Predicting the arrival times of detectable quantities of
such gases is important for verifying (non-)compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test-Ban Treaty. Gas breakthrough times are highly sensitive to uncertainties
associated with a variety of hydrogeologic parameters, including: rock type, fracture
aperture, matrix permeability, porosity, and saturation). We conduct this research using
a bilateral approach that combines laboratory gas experiments and numerical modeling
to hone certain simplifying assumptions in our current models of gas transport. Using a
gas diffusion cell, we are able to measure air pressure transmission through fractured
tuff core samples while also measuring Xe gas breakthrough measured using a mass
spectrometer. We can thus create synthetic barometric fluctuations akin to those
observed in field tests and measure the associated gas flow through the fracture and
matrix pore space for varying degrees of fluid saturation. We then attempt to reproduce
the experimental results using numerical models in PLFOTRAN and FEHM codes to
better understand the importance of different parameters on radionuclide gas transport.
In so doing, we can better determine the appropriateness of several different common
flow and transport model assumptions in representing these transport processes. This
will aid us in our application of such models to larger, field-scale tests and improve our
ability to predict surface gas breakthrough times.
