<!-- **Title:**  The Mars Underground: Characterizing subsurface methane seepage on the Red Planet -->
<!--  -->
<!-- **Abstract:** -->
<!-- > The existence of methane on Mars is a topic of significant interest because it is a potential biosignature – a sign of past or present life. General consensus is that, whether the source of methane is biogenic or abiogenic, it is most likely generated underground. To date, neither the source of methane on Mars nor the mechanism for transmission from the subsurface to the atmosphere are fully understood. Another part of this mystery is that measurements of atmospheric methane collected by Curiosity rover indicate that concentrations vary both seasonally and over short time scales (i.e., from hours to a couple sols). As the *Curiosity* rover nears the end of its life, onboard power becomes an increasing concern, and the pump life of the atmospheric sampler becomes a highly valuable resource. In order to balance these concerns, as well as the needs of other science areas of the mission, we need to be strategic in the choice of times that Curiosity collects its remaining samples. -->

<!-- In the first part of this talk, I will present numerical flow and transport simulations of deeply-sourced methane venting to Mars’ atmosphere via barometric-pressure pumping – a common process on Earth whereby atmospheric fluctuations progressively pull underground gases upward through fracture networks to the surface. We propose that this could be an effective mechanism to explain how deep underground methane reaches the atmosphere and produces the short-term variations observed. -->

<!-- In the second part of this talk, I will discuss ongoing work that uses these barometric pumping simulations to try to predict optimal times for Curiosity to collect methane samples. The simulations incorporate more advanced physics and atmospheric coupling in order to identify potential timing of experiments that would maximize the scientific returns of the final stage of Curiosity’s mission. -->
