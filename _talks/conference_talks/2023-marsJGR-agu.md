**Abstract:**
> In recent years, the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on board the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) *Curiosity* rover has detected methane variations in the atmosphere at Gale crater. Methane concentrations appear to fluctuate seasonally as well as sub-diurnally, which is difficult to reconcile with an as-yet-unknown transport mechanism delivering the gas from underground to the atmosphere. We consider barometrically-induced transport of methane from an underground source to the surface, modulated by temperature-dependent adsorption as a mechanism to potentially explain the fluctuations. The subsurface fractured-rock seepage model is coupled to a simplified atmospheric mixing model to provide insights on the pattern of atmospheric methane concentrations in response to transient surface methane emissions, as well as to predict sub-diurnal variation in methane abundance for the Northern Summer period, which is a candidate time frame for *Curiosity*â€™s potentially final sampling campaign. The best-performing scenarios indicate a significant, short-lived methane pulse just prior to sunrise, the detection of which by SAM-TLS would be a potential indicator of the contribution of barometric pumping to Mars' atmospheric methane variations.
